CrossLingualSpeechSynthesizor
=============================
This is a project I've done on the Tsinghua University Yao class course called Human and Machine spoken communications.

This project has proposed a method which use english model and speech data to synthesize two chinese sentences which is "你好，早上好" and "东北菜，好吃".

The result lies in the wav files.
The pdf has described the whole project and the results.
The bin and model files contains some necessary files for phoneme recognition.
